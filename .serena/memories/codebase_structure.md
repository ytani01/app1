# Codebase Structure
The project has a relatively simple structure:

-   `.git/`: Git version control system directory.
-   `.python-version`: Specifies the Python version to be used with `uv`.
-   `pyproject.toml`: Project metadata, dependencies, and build configuration using `uv`.
-   `README.md`: Project description and basic information.
-   `uv.lock`: Lock file generated by `uv` to ensure reproducible builds.
-   `.venv/`: Virtual environment managed by `uv`.
-   `src/`: Source code directory.
    -   `app1/`: Python package for the application.
        -   `__init__.py`: Likely contains the main game logic or imports it.
