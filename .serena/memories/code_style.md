# Code Style and Conventions
This project adheres to Python best practices. `ruff` is used for both linting and formatting, ensuring consistent code style. Type hints are enforced using `mypy` for improved code quality and maintainability.

## Key aspects:
- **Formatting:** Managed by `ruff`.
- **Linting:** Managed by `ruff`.
- **Type Hinting:** Encouraged and checked by `mypy`.
- **Naming Conventions:** Follows standard Python (PEP8) conventions.
- **Docstrings:** No explicit standard mentioned, but good practice suggests their use for functions, classes, and modules.
